        <h2>ABOUT</h2>

        <p>
            We are a friendly and not suspicious corporation that does NOT have any secrets, 
            or secret laboratories and facilities with observation chambers to keep an eye on our test subjects 
            we use to experiment on and research for an advanced AI technology that could theoratically take over and destroy our universe 
            that has already killed most of our employees and causes so much panic that we have to evacuate the entire facility 
            but one of our test subjects is stuck in a chamber and is the most advanced one from our universe 
            because this test subject is controlled by a human which we use to take research on to figure out how smart and good the humans are 
            why we have made a special arrangement of test chambers just for this one specimen, 
            because we care about our customers, employees and our universe! We try to make new things to help us out and not any evil stuff!
        </p>
